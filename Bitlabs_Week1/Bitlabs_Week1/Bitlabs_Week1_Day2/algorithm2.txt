1 write an algorithm to find whether a student is eligible to take admission in a college (if percentage is greater than 85 then he is eligible to take admission)

step 1: start
step 2: read the percentage scored by the student
step 3: if(percentage>85)
        	print "eligible for admission"
        else
		print "not eligible for admission"
step 4: end

2 write an algorithm to find the largest of two numbers

step 1: start
step 2: read two numbers into the variables n1,n2
step 3: if(n1>n2)
		print"n1 is greater"
	else
		print"n2 is greater"
step 4: end

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3 write an algorithm to find largest of three numbers

step 1: start
step 2: read the three numbers; number1, number2, number3
step 3: if(number1>number2 and number1>number3)
		print "number1 is greatest"
	else if(number2>number1 and number2>number3)
		print "number2 is greatest"
	else
		print "number3 is greatest"
step 4: end

4 Solve the calculator application that will give the result for all arithmetic applications like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with the following scenario.

i. build an algorithm that will promote dynamic data for variables

step 1: start
step 2: read any two numbers into the variables num1,num2
step 3: compute add=num1+num2
	compute subb=num1-num2
	compute mul=num1*num2
	compute div=num1/num2
step 4: print add,subb,mul,div
step 5: end

ii. build an algorithm that will promote static data  for variables

step 1: start
step 2: assign num1=25, num2=90
step 3: compute add=num1+num2
	compute subb=num1-num2
	compute mul=num1*num2
	compute div=num1/num2
step 4: print add,subb,mul,div
step 5: end

iii. build an algorithm with the following condition

find division only in case both variables are +ve
find subtraction in case the first variable is +ve, the second variable is â€“ve
find addition in case of both variables are â€“ve the find addition
find multiplication if both variables are â€“ve

step 1: start
step 2: read values for num1 and num2
step 3: if(num1>0 and num2>0)
	div=num1/num2
	else if(num1>0 and num2<0)
	subb=num1-num2
	else if(num1<0 and num2<0)
	add=num1+num2
	else
	mul=num1*num2
step 4: print add,sub,mul,div
step 5: end
