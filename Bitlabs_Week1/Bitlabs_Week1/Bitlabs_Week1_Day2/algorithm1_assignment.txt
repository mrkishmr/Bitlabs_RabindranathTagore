1) Build an algorithm for the following problems: 

i. Defined the Greatest number among any given two numbers

step 1: start
step 2: read two numbers into the variables n1,n2
step 3: if(n1>n2)
		print"n1 is greater"
	else
		print"n2 is greater"
step 4: end

ii. Check a number is +ve , -ve or 0

step 1: start
step 2: read the number into the variable num
step 3: if(num>0)
		print number is a positive integer
	else if(num<0)
		print number is a negative integer
	else
		print number
step 4: end

iii. check number is divisible by 7 and 3

step 1: start
step 2: read the number into the variable num
step 3: if (((num%3)==0)and((num%7)==0)))
        	print the number is divisible by 7 and 3
	else
		print the number is not divisibe by 7 and 3
step 4: end

iv. A person is eligible to vote or not.

step 1: start
step 2: read the age
step 3: if(age>18)
		print the person is eligible to vote
	else 
		print the person is not eligible to vote
step 4: end

v. a number is even or odd

step 1: start
step 2: read the number into the variable num
step 3: if ((num%2)==0)
        	print the number is an even number
	else
		print the number is an odd number
step 4: end


vi. A person is eligible for the loan or not based on his CIBIL score
		if Cibil Score is above 700 eligible for any loan
		if the Cibil score is less than 700 not eligible for any loan

step 1: start
step 2: read the cibil score of the person into the variable cibil 
step 3: if(cibil>700)
		print the person is eligible to take a loan
	else 
		print the person is not eligible to take a loan
step 4: end

2)Write an algorithm for the following

 A company will give a bonus to their employees based on their service in the company
below 1 year: 3000 Rs bonus
below 2 years: 20 % of salary as a bonus
below 5 years: 30 % of salary as a bonus
5 years or above: 10000 Rs as a bonus

step 1: start
step 2: read the salary and no of years of the employee into the variables salary and years
step 3: if(year<1)
		assign bonus=3000
	else if((year>=1) and (year<2))
		compute bonus=(salary*20)/100
	else if((year>=2 and (year<=5)
		compute bonus=(salary*30)/100
	else
		assign bonus=10000
step 4: compute total_salary=salary+bonus
step 5: print total_salary
step 6: end

3) Assume that the following South Indian states charge 1 litre of petrol as per the following conditions. 
 
Build an algorithm that will give petrol prices in any state if the state name has given

AP: startingprice+ 12 Rs Service charge
TS: startingprice+ 10 Rs Service charge
TN: startingprice+ 9 Rs Service charge
KA: startingprice+ 9 Rs Service charge
KL: startingprice+ 8 Rs Service charge

step 1: start
step 2: read the price of petrol into the variable starting_price
step 3: read the state code into the string variable state
step 4: if((state=="AP"))
		compute petrol_rate=starting_price+12
	else if((state=="TS"))
		compute petrol_rate=starting_price+10
        else if((state=="TN"))
		compute petrol_rate=starting_price+9
	else if((state=="KA"))
		compute petrol_rate=starting_price+9
	else if((state=="KL"))
		compute petrol_rate=starting_price+8
	else 
		print please enter a valid state code
step 5: print petrol_rate
step 6: end
