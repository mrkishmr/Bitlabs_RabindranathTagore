Features of JAVA

1) Platform Independent
2) Supports Multithreading
3) Highly secure and portable
4) Automatic garbage collection
5) Memory optimisation
6) Code reusability
7) Architectural neutral
8) Has its own JVM for code compilation

public <-- access modifier

static <-- calling the method without the use of object 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Steps to compile and run a JAVA Program

1) write the program and save it in the format
   filename.java where .java is the extension for java file
2) in the command line enter the command
   javac filename.java
3) after entering the above command, the java code is compiled and converted to bytecode
4) the bytecode cannot be understandable, hence it is converted into machine level code using JVM
5) to run the java program enter the command
   java filename

JDK - stands for Java Development kit and it is used for compiling and running JAVA programs and mainly used for developing Java based applications, the JDK contains tools such as JRE and class libraries 
JVM - stands for Java Virtual Machine and is used for conversion of bytecode of program to machine code during compilation
JRE - stands for Java Runtime Environment and is used to run java programs

--> sections in a java program

    documentation section

    package declaration

    import declarations

    interface statements

    class declarations

    main method class{
    main method definition
    }

tokens:- are the small and main important elements in a JAVA program

the different tokens are 

i) Keywords:- keywords are the special reserved words in Java which are defined for a specific purpose
   these keywords are predefined and cannot be changed by the user

ii) Identifiers:- Identifiers are the elements which are unique and are holding a value

iii) Literals:- literals are the values which are used in JAVA
		they can be either numeric or character literal

iv) Operators:- operators are used to perform soome specific operation such as arithmetic, logical, relational etc.

Rules for Identifiers

1) an identifier can have alphabets, numbers, underscore and dollar($)symbol
2) an identifier should only start with alphabet
3) an identifier cannot have whitespaces
4) keywords cannot be used as identifiers

Data types:- data types are used in aprogram to define the type of data, such as numerical or alphabet, to deal with a program

data types are basically classifed into two types

1) primitive data type
2) non primitive data type

1) primitive data types are further classified as
   a) numeric data type
      	byte - 1 byte - ranges from -128 to 127
      	short - 2 bytes - ranges from -2^15 to 2^15 - 1
      	int - 4 bytes - ranges from -2^31 to 2^31 - 1
      	long - 8 bytes - ranges from -2^63 to 2^63 - 1
      	float - 4 bytes
      	double  - 8 bytes

   b) non numeric data type
	boolean - 1 bit
	character - 2 bytes

2) under non primitive data type, we have
   a) String
   b) Array
   c) User defined class

variable:- variable is a temporary storage space which contains a value in it
           ex:- a=2 which means that the value 2 is stored in a where a is the variable 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1)write a program to convert a integer value into floating value

//program to illustrate implicit type conversion

public class Widen
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		int a=2;
		float b=float(a);
		System.out.println("before conversion the value is "+a);
		System.out.println("after conversion the value is "+b);
        }
}
