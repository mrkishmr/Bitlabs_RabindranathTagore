1 start
  read length, breadth
  compute the area of the triangle using the formula; area <-- length*breadth
  print area

--> write an algorithm to compute the gross salary of an employee 
    gross_salary = basic_salary+DA+HRA

2 
step 1: start
step 2: read basic_salary
step 3: calculate DA using the formula DA <-- (50/100)*basic_salary
step 4: calculate HRA using the formula HRA <-- (20/100)*basic_salary
step 5: calculate gross_salary using the formula gross_salary <-- basic_salary+DA+HRA 
step 6: print gross_salary
step 7: end
  
  variables ---> basic_salary,DA,HRA,gross_salary

3 write an algorithm to swap two numbers

step 1: start
step 2: read the two numbers into the variables num1 and num2 
step 3: assign a number to the temp variable as temp = num1
step 4: compute num1 = num2
step 5: compute num2 = temp
step 6: print num1 and num2
step 7: end
